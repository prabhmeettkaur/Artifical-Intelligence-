# Artifical-Intelligence
- AI project ie MC-FPA
  he MC-FPA is a project based on algorithms of artificial intelligence where the fastest path (not necessarily the shortest) can be found while considering various other factors such as speed limit, traffic and distance. This project is somewhat based on Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and its subsidiaries such as Partial Travelling Salesman and Optional TSP. This type of system
could be helpful for drivers, delivery companies, and other entities that need to
determine the fastest way to get from one place to another.
The way it works is: It will be taking input from the user about the source and
destination and will be using different algorithms (while keeping in mind the
traffic condition and speed limit of each path) to predict the path that will be
quickest and most efficient for the user to reach the destination.
